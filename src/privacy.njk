    <h2 class="section-title h5 mt-4">Visiting the website</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      When visiting this website, the following data is automatically collected and stored for a maximum of 15 days:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-muted">
      <li>IP address</li>
      <li>User-Agent string (identifies browser and possibly operating system)</li>
      <li>Referrer URL (the web address that refers to our site)</li>
      <li>Date and time</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-muted">
      These data have a personal reference due to the combination of time and IP address, but are necessary to identify
      potential disruptors and thus ensure trouble-free operation. After anonymization by omitting the IP address, we
      gain insights into the use of the website, e.g., how many users visit the website, which pages are popular, and
      from which websites visitors come here. This information primarily serves the technical and editorial further
      development.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title h5 mt-4">Information, blocking, and deletion</h2>
    <p class="text-muted mb-0">
      Upon written or text-form request, we will inform you at any time about which personal data we have stored about you.
      You also have the right to request the correction, blocking, or deletion of this data. You can always contact the
      supervisory authority responsible for you with a complaint. Your responsible supervisory authority depends on the
      federal state of your residence, your work, or the alleged violation. A list of supervisory authorities with
      addresses can be found on the website of the Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
