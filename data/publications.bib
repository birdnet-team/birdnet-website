  author={Tseng, Sunny and Hodder, Dexter P and Otter, Ken A},
  journal={Journal of Ornithology},

  publisher={Springer},
  tags={Best Practices},
  url={https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-025-02260-w},
  summary={This study compares species-specific versus universal confidence thresholds for BirdNET detections and evaluates their effects on precision–recall trade-offs. The authors show that species-specific thresholds generally yield better classification performance but that universal thresholds may be acceptable where data are limited, and they provide practical recommendations for threshold selection in ecological studies.}
